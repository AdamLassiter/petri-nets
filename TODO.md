# List of things to think about...

## Features
* Prettyprint sequent proofs?
    * In LaTeX?


## Optimisations
* Expand matrix on dimension increase rather than copy
    * Does this provide much benefeit? l^(n) vs l^(n+1) or l*(n) vs l*(n+1)
* Store only upper triangular matrix
    * Approx half memory usage
* Store a boolean n-tuple for tokens as (1, 1, 2) ~= (1, 2, 2)
    * Approx one eigth memory usage
* Check converse statement as early halt condition
    * Approx twice time and memory


## Writeup
* Testing and Useful Examples
    * Formal
        * Correctness
        * Consistency
        * Dimensionality
    * Informal
        * Time Efficiency
        * Space Efficiency
        * What expressions are quick, what are slow
        * What optimisations help 
            * Token sort and rbtree
            * P v Â¬P -> T
            * 1-bit bools
            * etc...
* Differentiate carefully between CL, ALL, MLL
