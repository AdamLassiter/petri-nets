    \section*{Connection-Based Proof Method}
        Examining the work of \citet{connection-based-proof-method}, it is apparent that their connection-based proof method is analogous to the exact opposite sort of proof search.
        Where here proofs are constructed top-down using a dense representation (across all subformulae and possible contexts up to dimensionality $n$), their method equates to a bottom-up sparse search.
