\section{Dimensionality}
    
    \begin{definition*}[Dimensionality]
        Given a formula $P$, the coalescence proof search produces a proof in an $n$-dimensional petri net.
        Equivalently, an additively stratified sequent proof $\vdash P$ has $n$ terms at the bottom before any contractions are applied.
        The dimensionality of $P$ is then defined $\dim(P) \defeq n$.

    \begin{definition*}[Classes of Formulae]
        Let $A^i$ be the subclasses of formulae defined as:
        \begin{align*}
            A^1 \quad &\defeq \quad \top \,|\, \bot \,|\, A^1 \wedge A^1 \,|\, A^* \vee A^1 \\
            A^2 \quad &\defeq \quad A^1 \,|\, \textit{Additive Linear Logic} \,|\, A^* \vee A^2 \,|\, P \vee \neg P
        \end{align*}
        where $A^* \defeq \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i$, such that $A^n$ is the class of all formulae provable in n dimensions.
    \end{definition*}


    \begin{remark*}[Satisfiability vs Provability]
        For any formula $P$, there exist four distinct classes: \textit{true, false, satisfiably true, satisfiably false}, where satisfiable differs by finding a particular assignment of values to each variable.
        Coalescence searches for a proof of $P$ in \textit{true}, whereas the SAT problem addresses a proof of $P$ in \textit{true}.

    \begin{proposition*}[$ax$-Bound on Dimensionality]
        \begin{align*}
            \dim(P) &\leq 1 + \#\{ax\textit{-Rule} \in \,\, \vdash P\} \\
            \dim(P) &\leq 1 + \#\{vars \in P\}
        \end{align*}
    \end{proposition*}

    \begin{proof}
        The first case is trivial.
        Given a formula $P$ and a constructed sequent proof $\vdash P$ through coalescence, additive stratification ensures that $\dim(P) = n \implies leaves(P) \geq n$.
        As each of the $n$ branches of the tree moves `upwards', they must either terminate at an $ax$-rule or branch, leaving $n + 1$ branches total.
        Subsequently, for each $ax$-rule forming a leaf of the tree, $\dim(P)$ increases by no more than one.
        Finally, consider a base case such as $P \seteq \vdash a \vee \neg a$ where $\dim(P) = 2 \leq 1 + \#\{ax-Rule \in \vdash P\}$ (in this case, it is equal).
        
        Second case omitted. %% TODO
